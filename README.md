# Product README Generator

Based on the readme template published [here](https://github.com/dbader/readme-template).

Scrappy library to generate a markdown file from a Python object's data using the template linked to above.

It's not fully functional at the moment â€“ it only works on templates that exactly match class attribute names (currently: my_product, blurb, badge), but the rest will be added later.

Otherwise, to make it actually useful I will be developing a CLI and ability to generate the Python object from a JSON file.
